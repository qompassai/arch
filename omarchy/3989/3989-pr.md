# WIP PR plan for #3989 – Screen sharing fails in v3.2.3: The new share picker (hyprland-preview-share-picker) returns selection -1

Labels: bug
Repo: basecamp/omarchy
Upstream issue: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/3989

## Summary

_Replace this section with a concise summary of the fix._

## Upstream issue context (snippet)

```text
### System details

AMD Ryzen 7 4800H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, Omarchy 3.2.3

### What's wrong?

After updating to Omarchy 3.2.3, screen sharing functionality (Google Meet via Firefox, Discord, etc.) stopped working completely. When initiating a screen share, the window/screen selection dialog never appears, and the request fails immediately.

Investigating the `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland` logs reveals that the session is destroyed instantly with `SHAREDATA returned selection -1`, indicating the picker binary is failing to launch or crashing immediately.
