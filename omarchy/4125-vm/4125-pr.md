## Upstream issue context (snippet)

### System details

Beelink SER9, AMD H255

### What's wrong?

After the update to Omarchy's new version, there is a problem where the `omarchy-windows-vm` command hangs on launch, even though the VM is running. As you can see in the screenshot, the status function get's information about the VM running and I can actually see the Windows desktop in the browser at the web interface link. However, when I run the launch function, it just hangs there with the message "Waiting for Windows VM to be ready".
