## Summary

* D1: \[short summary of primary behavior change]
  * Lines: \[`<file>#Lxx-Lyy`]\(\<https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<sha>/<path>#Lxx-Lyy>)

## Upstream issue context (snippet)

```text
### System details

Framework Overkill, AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, NVIDIA Gefore RTX 5070

### What's wrong?

When I close and reopen the laptop lid (suspend/resume cycle), the screen stays black. Sometimes requires closing and reopening the lid 2-3 times before the display works again. Not super consistent

I think It's NVIDIA causing it. I haven't made a fix like this to something like an distro but I'll give it a shot
