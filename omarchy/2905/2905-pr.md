# WIP PR plan for #2905 – Add the ability to install in multi-boot situations

Labels: enhancement, help wanted
Repo: basecamp/omarchy
Upstream issue: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2905

## Summary

_Replace this section with a concise summary of the fix._

## Upstream issue context (snippet)

```text
Within the [configurator](https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-iso/blob/main/configs/airootfs/root/configurator), we currently only support selecting and wiping a full disk.

This leaves a fair number of users who have a legitimate need for dual booting out in the cold and stuck going through a manual install process. This is less than ideal, for many reasons; not the least of which are user experience and just generally being more error prone.

We should add a **simple** way for users to install Omarchy using the ISO. There are effectively 2 ways I think this could be accomplished easily.

### 1.) Use Free Space
Require the user to effectively make room for Omarchy on disk. From there, we analyze the disk and establish partition details to utilize the free space only that gets passed over to our archinstall JSON.

We could offer a utility as well at the screen where you're able to perform this like gparted or otherwise so the user could adjust their partitions there but most likely, they will have done that already in preparation from within a GUI.
```
