- Comments: 5

- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/4033

Omarchy currently only recognizes keybinds from the main keyboard’s top row numbers, not the numpad—could you add support for numpad keys (e.g., Numpad1)? 
For example, moving the focused window to virtual desktop 1 could be bound to SUPER SHIFT Numpad1, just like SUPER SHIFT 1 works now. This would improve flexibility for users who rely on the numpad for shortcuts.

I've been trying to set this up by hand from the `~/.config/hypr/input.conf `without success so far

Within the [configurator](https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-iso/blob/main/configs/airootfs/root/configurator), we currently only support selecting and wiping a full disk.

This leaves a fair number of users who have a legitimate need for dual booting out in the cold and stuck going through a manual install process. This is less than ideal, for many reasons; not the least of which are user experience and just generally being more error prone.

We should add a **simple** way for users to install Omarchy using the ISO. There are effectively 2 ways I think this could be accomplished easily.

- Comments: 5
- Labels: enhancement, help wanted
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2880

### What do you need?

While we never really see the SDDM login screen due to autologin, I do think it'd be nice to have one that matches the general aesthetic of the Hyprlock screen for instances where it may be seen (eg. Hyprland crashes) or if you're a user who uses multiple user accounts and need to switch.

Most login screens I've come across are massive packs of options OR are just overly complex. I think it's important that we maintain a simple and consistent aesthetic, and preferably also update the BG that's shown on theme change as well.

### What do you need?

In recovery situations, it's often the case that we need to be able to use chroot to access our device from a failed state. It'd be great to add a tool that could be included in the ISO that makes this process a lot more seamless to accomplish if you have the ISO available to you on a USB to aid in debug / recovery.

Below are the steps I commonly use and supply to other. The idea is we could utilize gum prompts to allow the user to select the partitions instead and then handle some of the bits in the middle so we only have to get user input where we need it.

### What do you need?

I’m experiencing a Wi-Fi connectivity issue in Omarchy 3.1. My PC’s built-in Wi-Fi doesn’t function unless I use an external USB Wi-Fi antenna/adapter. On other operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, and Fedora, I can choose between the internal Wi-Fi and the external adapter directly from the Wi-Fi settings.

However, in Omarchy 3.1, this option no longer appears. The system only shows one non-functional Wi-Fi interface. In Omarchy 3.0, the external antenna was somehow working automatically without me having to select it — when I unplugged it, the Wi-Fi stopped working, meaning it was being used by default. Now in Omarchy 3.1, it does not connect at all, even when the antenna is plugged in.

When trying to use screen recording on a fresh Omarchy installation, the recording failed silently — no video file was saved. After checking the logs, I found the following message:

`gsr_get_supported_video_codecs_vaapi: vaInitialize failed`

This error means VAAPI wasn’t initialized correctly because the proper driver was missing. And according to assada's comment, the solution depends on the GPU vendor:

## Issue

After installing Omarchy, I noticed boot time was around 2 minutes 39 seconds, which seemed excessive. After investigating with `systemd-analyze` and `journalctl`, I found that `tpm2.target` was waiting approximately 90 seconds for TPM devices (`/dev/tpm0` and `/dev/tpmrm0`) that don't exist on my system.

I do have 4k external monitor hooked up to my laptop. All animations even cursor movement is very laggy, feels 30Hz. I almost never use laptop monitor. So gaving controls in Setup -> Config would be nice to have controls for iGPU and dGPU priorities.

### What do you need?

This PR is great https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/pull/1458 and is primarily aimed at web apps with no location bar. Right now the only way to use it is via keyboard shortcut. Even though the icon shows up in the normal chrome browser, clicking on it doesn't do anything and the "copy url" action is grayed out. I've made a [small modification](https://github.com/davidguttman/omarchy/commit/3c6555f415d8f733956c8ddeed624b5360f2de26) to my local version to work on click and can open a PR if there's interest.

### What do you need?

I've installed Omarchy on a Macbook Pro 16,1 and a Macbook Pro (Retina 13 inch, late 2012/E) and in both cases, while the install went very well, the keyboard backlight was "off" and the controls for the keyboard (touchbar in the first case, physical key in the second) didn't work. It would be user friendly to, while waiting for solid fixes to the touchbar and physical key controls for keyboard backlight, to set the following:

```brightnessctl -d "{device_name}" set 100%``` (where "device_name" is the led device on the given machine)...

I wanted to try using the new iso installer (with latest configurator https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-configurator). installed all within 7 minutes on my framework 13! now when i log into my machine... it looks like i have wifi (like the upper right corner looks like a full wifi status bar) but ping fails, as well as navigating to any website. not sure if anything changed in 2.1.0 but ive had 0 issues with getting wifi working in the past with omarchy (i have legitimately installed it probably over 50 times through alphas/betas/isos/etc as well as other distros).

I'm investigating and will edit the OP as I stumble upon any new findings.

edit: seems like they were disabled via software? i ran `sudo rfkill unblock all` and that fixed it. not sure if any changes were made recently that would have caused this.

Hypridle should support different actions based on power source. On battery, screensavers drain power unnecessarily. Just turning off the display would be better. When plugged in, screensavers are fine.

Example:

### Issue #1239: I18n week starts on Monday

I was wondering how I can set my preferred date-time formatting in Chrome. On macOS I was used to having this in the system settings, but I can’t find a similar option here.  

Right now, a a default date-time picker starts the week on Sunday, while I would prefer it to start on Monday. I’d also like to have the format day-month-year instead of month-day-year. Is there a way to configure this in Omarchy or Chrome?

### Issue #1125: Cannot Recover from Suspense Mode

Hi!

After updating to 2.0.0 (and 2.0.1), the computer can no longer recover from Suspense Mode. Whenever it goes to suspense, the screen for setting the password does not show and all I get is a black screen. I then need to press the power button to forcefully kill and restart it.

For reference this is my spec:

### Issue #1047: "env = SDL_VIDEODRIVER, wayland" prevents some games from opening

The Omarchy default Hyprland environment variable "env = SDL_VIDEODRIVER, wayland" can prevent some games from opening. Error of "Failed to initialize dependencies".

This occurred when launching the game "Squad" through Steam, using Proton 9.0-4. My assumption is this is most likely something to do with EasyAntiCheat.

Commenting out "env = SDL_VIDEODRIVER, wayland" and reloading Hyprland allowed the game to open.

This fixed the issue:

I attempted to install arch on an old MBP and ran into some interesting challenges.

This is relevant here now because I just attempted to install the iso and had similarly strange issues.

### Issue #856: Fingerprint fallback to password auth failing

I've had this working on my primary machine running Arch + Gnome without problems, but with Omarchy on my ThinkPad X1, I can't `esc` or `ctrl-c` out of the fingerprint auth to get to password. The only option is to wait for the long time out. All menu-based options trap `ctrl-c` and quit. For terminal-based auth, `ctrl-c` does get me to a password prompt, but it's captured as the first character in the password, making it impossible to successfully enter my password.

The only exception is `hypridle`, where, of course, I can just type the password.

The cleanest approach I've found has been to do something like this in `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`, before the line containing `pam_fprintd.so`:

### Issue #405: Washed colors on intel gpu hdmi monitor

My laptop has an intel gpu and when I plugged in HDMI the colors looked very washed (this also happened on X11)

This is a known problem with intel GPUs and the arch linux wiki has a fix for this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Intel_graphics#Fix_colors_for_Wayland

Can this become a part of the omarchy installer?

### Issue #394: suspend on BeeLink SER9 (and new Framework 13 AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370)

When using the "Suspend" on BeeLink SER9, after issuing "suspend" Beelink device fans spin up and what I see immediately is a lock screen (so looks like it is not suspending). After unlocking, `WLAN0` interface is gone. Running `lspci -knnd ::0280` shows:
