### What do you need?

On iOS (with e.g. macOS or Windows) I’m able to use my iPhone to exchange authentication keys (passkeys / FIDO2 / WebAuthn) and approve sign-ins, but this does not work when using Omarchy. I believe the root cause is that iOS expects a platform authenticator or BLE/Apple API handshake which Arch (Omarchy) currently does not support

### Issue #2905: Add the ability to install in multi-boot situations

Within the [configurator](https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-iso/blob/main/configs/airootfs/root/configurator), we currently only support selecting and wiping a full disk.

This leaves a fair number of users who have a legitimate need for dual booting out in the cold and stuck going through a manual install process. This is less than ideal, for many reasons; not the least of which are user experience and just generally being more error prone.

We should add a **simple** way for users to install Omarchy using the ISO. There are effectively 2 ways I think this could be accomplished easily.

### What do you need?

There are a few options available to us to provide a better experience for users to configure their monitors. 

I think something like nwg-display is a little to heavy and doesn't fit the vibe of Omarchy but some candidates I do think could be fit are:

### Issue #2742: Wi-Fi adapter not recognized or configurable in Omarchy 3.1 (worked partially in 3.0)

- Comments: 3
- Labels: enhancement

### What do you need?

I’m experiencing a Wi-Fi connectivity issue in Omarchy 3.1. My PC’s built-in Wi-Fi doesn’t function unless I use an external USB Wi-Fi antenna/adapter. On other operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, and Fedora, I can choose between the internal Wi-Fi and the external adapter directly from the Wi-Fi settings.

However, in Omarchy 3.1, this option no longer appears. The system only shows one non-functional Wi-Fi interface. In Omarchy 3.0, the external antenna was somehow working automatically without me having to select it — when I unplugged it, the Wi-Fi stopped working, meaning it was being used by default. Now in Omarchy 3.1, it does not connect at all, even when the antenna is plugged in.

### What do you need?

First, thanks for a great out-of-box arch experience, mainly been dabbling, but its been fun! Here's an idea I wanted to do as a home project

Take a mini-pc such as https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8845hs?_pos=1&_fid=90f0072bc&_ss=c. This PC would live in my networking closet, and then be primarily accessed remotely, for me from MSTSC but really any remote-desktop client. I started down the road of installing and configuring xrdp/Xorg and making some progress, but its been a slog, I wanted to offer the idea up here in case I'm going down a bad path or there is a more elegant (Omarchy worthy) solution. I'll keep tooling around and update this if I find anything good.

- Comments: 2

- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2534

### What do you need?

Special Workspaces are super useful in hyprland. They can be configured to toggle visibility of their windows so they appear/dissappear on demand. While hiding they continue to run in the background, keeping the state intact. It would be great to show a couple of them in the hypr config so people know they exist and can understand their use. For example here is a scratch terminal and a 'calculator' (rather irb playground)

Hi there, great job with your config overall! Congrats!

I've noticed that in `default/hypr/apps/browser.conf` there's a rule that intends to give a subtle opacity ( `1 0.97` ), slightly different to general opacity set in `default/hypr/windows.conf` ( `0.97 0.9` )

I'd like to request a way so that we could recieve notifications from webapps, like google calendar desktop notifications, microsoft teams message notifications, etc. i've been trying to find a way to do this but it only notifies if the tab is open. And yes, i have desktop notifications enabled but they don't show unless i have the app/tab open.


### Issue #2117: Gaming and Window Transparency

- Opened: 2025-09-30T19:02:34Z
- Comments: 6
- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2117

### The Situation:

The slight transparency on the focused window looks very nice for most apps but becomes a visual sore when it comes to games. You can typically see your Steam launcher and desktop background faintly behind the game, particularly if the scene is dark. Doesn't seem to be a problem when running games full screen, but many games run smoother in "Borderless Windowed" mode where the transparency becomes a factor.

The setting is easy enough to change in the hyprland config files, but it would be nice if there were some way that it could be slightly transparent for apps like code editors or browsers, but remain solid for games and video editors out of the box.

(Some) Windows applications work quite well once you install [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) (menu -> install -> package -> wine).
`.exe` files are automatically associated with Wine and execute when you double click them in the file browser. I did have to fiddle with `winecfg` and scale the DPI under the _Graphics_ tab way up to make applications readable, but this may be display hardware dependent.

It is has become basically the standard in the Linux Desktop space. it has by far the best support and a lot of apps (such as VPNs) need it to work.

I have really like Omarchy so far, but I think systemd-networkd is not a viable option for a complete desktop system. Have already bumped into a lot of issues were

### Issue #1401: Installing from `omarchy-online.iso` wipes the Windows 11 boot entry

Thanks for the great setup. `omarchy-online.iso` is a huge time-saver compared to installing everything from a base arch ISO.

One problem I encountered was that I had an existing Windows 11 installation on one hard drive, after installing from `omarchy-online.iso` to a different hard drive, the Windows boot entry was wiped.

I wrote up a guide on how to resolve this and get Windows 11 into the Limine boot menu here: [dual-boot-omarchy-windows](https://github.com/jackos/dotfiles/blob/main/dual-boot-omarchy-windows.md) as it took a few hours to figure out.

When using the "Suspend" on BeeLink SER9, after issuing "suspend" Beelink device fans spin up and what I see immediately is a lock screen (so looks like it is not suspending). After unlocking, `WLAN0` interface is gone. Running `lspci -knnd ::0280` shows:
