### Issue #4033: add numPad numbers support for tiling navigation

- Comments: 5

- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/4033

Omarchy currently only recognizes keybinds from the main keyboard’s top row numbers, not the numpad—could you add support for numpad keys (e.g., Numpad1)? 
For example, moving the focused window to virtual desktop 1 could be bound to SUPER SHIFT Numpad1, just like SUPER SHIFT 1 works now. This would improve flexibility for users who rely on the numpad for shortcuts.

I've been trying to set this up by hand from the `~/.config/hypr/input.conf `without success so far

### What do you need?

I was thinking it would be nice to access the power menu from the locked session state.
When I suspend my computer it doesn't lock automatically, and that's fine, but I wish I could lock the session and then then suspend my pc.
Either in one click or by accessing a small power menu from the lock screen without having to unlock it. Same as when it goes idle.

- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/3065

### What do you need?

When I have a presentation, or if I want to run a long running backup without the system to sleep, lock or turn on screen saver, on MacOS I had an app [Lungo](https://setapp.com/apps/lungo), but there are many others like Caffeinate, etc.

Also when I run a Google Meet meeting, after a couple of time, my screen will freeze, get black for 4-6 seconds, and then go back (for the participans on the other end, my video freezes quickly. Audio works always). It feels like the screen saver interupts (as I might not have moved anything) - but I not 100%. So I'd like to have an awakening SW to try this.

On iOS (with e.g. macOS or Windows) I’m able to use my iPhone to exchange authentication keys (passkeys / FIDO2 / WebAuthn) and approve sign-ins, but this does not work when using Omarchy. I believe the root cause is that iOS expects a platform authenticator or BLE/Apple API handshake which Arch (Omarchy) currently does not support

### Issue #2905: Add the ability to install in multi-boot situations

Within the [configurator](https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-iso/blob/main/configs/airootfs/root/configurator), we currently only support selecting and wiping a full disk.

This leaves a fair number of users who have a legitimate need for dual booting out in the cold and stuck going through a manual install process. This is less than ideal, for many reasons; not the least of which are user experience and just generally being more error prone.

We should add a **simple** way for users to install Omarchy using the ISO. There are effectively 2 ways I think this could be accomplished easily.

### Issue #2880: Add a matching SDDM login screen theme

- Labels: enhancement, help wanted
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2880

### What do you need?

While we never really see the SDDM login screen due to autologin, I do think it'd be nice to have one that matches the general aesthetic of the Hyprlock screen for instances where it may be seen (eg. Hyprland crashes) or if you're a user who uses multiple user accounts and need to switch.

Most login screens I've come across are massive packs of options OR are just overly complex. I think it's important that we maintain a simple and consistent aesthetic, and preferably also update the BG that's shown on theme change as well.

### What do you need?

### Summary

Omarchy currently lacks a built-in keyboard layout switching mechanism, requiring users to manually add and configure layouts via system settings or Waybar. However, this limitation causes a critical usability issue during the authentication phase after auto logout.

### What do you need?

The About dialog for Omarchy does not use the default terminal app. Hence, it displays the Alacritty version even if another terminal has been installed and is being used as default, i.e. $TERMINAL = Ghostty or Kitty. I understand that Alacritty is still used for specialized tooling, even if another terminal is used as default.

I have modified my omarchy-launch-about to support Ghostty and Kitty too, as I am a Ghostty user myself.

### What do you need?

In recovery situations, it's often the case that we need to be able to use chroot to access our device from a failed state. It'd be great to add a tool that could be included in the ISO that makes this process a lot more seamless to accomplish if you have the ISO available to you on a USB to aid in debug / recovery.

Below are the steps I commonly use and supply to other. The idea is we could utilize gum prompts to allow the user to select the partitions instead and then handle some of the bits in the middle so we only have to get user input where we need it.

### What do you need?

I'd like the ability to navigate menus (eg `Super + Space`, `Super + Alt + Space`, etc.) with the `PgUp` and `PgDn` keys on my keyboard. Navigating with the arrow keys is often not as efficient, as the arrow keys only move up/down one item at a time. `PgUp` and `PgDn` keys should advance multiple items at a time (eg 10 items up or down, even better a viewable page length although the programming on that is significantly more I bet).

### What do you need?

I’m experiencing a Wi-Fi connectivity issue in Omarchy 3.1. My PC’s built-in Wi-Fi doesn’t function unless I use an external USB Wi-Fi antenna/adapter. On other operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, and Fedora, I can choose between the internal Wi-Fi and the external adapter directly from the Wi-Fi settings.

However, in Omarchy 3.1, this option no longer appears. The system only shows one non-functional Wi-Fi interface. In Omarchy 3.0, the external antenna was somehow working automatically without me having to select it — when I unplugged it, the Wi-Fi stopped working, meaning it was being used by default. Now in Omarchy 3.1, it does not connect at all, even when the antenna is plugged in.

- Opened: 2025-10-20T15:43:48Z
- Comments: 0

- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2624

I upgraded one of my notebooks from Omarchy 1.x (just before the first ISO) straight to 3.1. During the install I saw a few problems — for example, an ln step failed during migration. After the upgrade, some configs and keybindings stopped working, and a few settings looked reset.

My guess is the migration expects files/state that were introduced after 1.x, so jumping directly to 3.1 skips required steps. I’ve seen similar upgrade pains on Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Mandriva; you can mitigate them, but they tend to happen with big version jumps.

Suggestion: define “destination points” (upgrade waypoints). For example: 1 → 2 only, 2 → 3, 3 → latest. Even better if the installer/docs guide or enforce that path, or run a preflight check to warn/block unsupported jumps.

### Issue #2592: Slow boot on systems without TPM hardware (90 second delay)

## Issue

After installing Omarchy, I noticed boot time was around 2 minutes 39 seconds, which seemed excessive. After investigating with `systemd-analyze` and `journalctl`, I found that `tpm2.target` was waiting approximately 90 seconds for TPM devices (`/dev/tpm0` and `/dev/tpmrm0`) that don't exist on my system.

### What do you need?

First, thanks for a great out-of-box arch experience, mainly been dabbling, but its been fun! Here's an idea I wanted to do as a home project

Take a mini-pc such as https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8845hs?_pos=1&_fid=90f0072bc&_ss=c. This PC would live in my networking closet, and then be primarily accessed remotely, for me from MSTSC but really any remote-desktop client. I started down the road of installing and configuring xrdp/Xorg and making some progress, but its been a slog, I wanted to offer the idea up here in case I'm going down a bad path or there is a more elegant (Omarchy worthy) solution. I'll keep tooling around and update this if I find anything good.

Special Workspaces are super useful in hyprland. They can be configured to toggle visibility of their windows so they appear/dissappear on demand. While hiding they continue to run in the background, keeping the state intact. It would be great to show a couple of them in the hypr config so people know they exist and can understand their use. For example here is a scratch terminal and a 'calculator' (rather irb playground)

```

### What do you need?

I don't think omarchy necessarily is trying to cater to tablets... but touchscreen devices exist and the framework 12 is a delight to use omarchy with. the 12 tablet mode experience is actually pretty darn good in omarchy already... because its simple. it runs fast, scrolling works, the physical keyboard seems to disable when in tablet mode. 

seems like maybe 2 or 3 things would be necessary to actually use omarchy in touchscreen mode.

Feel free to close as this is fairly niche and I'm pretty new 'round these parts..

If you want to make Figma see local fonts (i.e. fonts in ~/.local/share/fonts):

1. Install https://github.com/neetly/figma-agent-linux via AUR installer

### Issue #2155: Suggest neovim presets apply to root as well as user for editing config files

### What do you need?

Thanks to DHH and all the contributors.

I was wondering if it would be good to default the root user neovim profile to the same lazyvim style presets as the normal user. As a newbie I found it slightly disconcerting when editing a file that required sudo that everything had changed in neovim. Perhaps it’s best practise to use sudoedit?

### WebApp desktop notifications even when app is closed

Hello there, firstly i'd like to thank yall for all the work, the product is amazing.
I'd like to request a way so that we could recieve notifications from webapps, like google calendar desktop notifications, microsoft teams message notifications, etc. i've been trying to find a way to do this but it only notifies if the tab is open. And yes, i have desktop notifications enabled but they don't show unless i have the app/tab open.

### Issue #2117: Gaming and Window Transparency

- Opened: 2025-09-30T19:02:34Z
- Comments: 6
- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2117

### The Situation:

The slight transparency on the focused window looks very nice for most apps but becomes a visual sore when it comes to games. You can typically see your Steam launcher and desktop background faintly behind the game, particularly if the scene is dark. Doesn't seem to be a problem when running games full screen, but many games run smoother in "Borderless Windowed" mode where the transparency becomes a factor.

The setting is easy enough to change in the hyprland config files, but it would be nice if there were some way that it could be slightly transparent for apps like code editors or browsers, but remain solid for games and video editors out of the box. 

### Issue #2114: An Improved Omarchy menu search to search sub-menus aswell.

### What do you need?

Hi, I started using Omarchy a few days ago and I’m really enjoying it—it feels like I finally found a stable setup for my Hyprland journey. One feature that would make it even better is if the Omarchy menu search could also search inside the main options on the main omarchy menu without going inside them first. 

This would make navigation much faster when looking for specific actions. For example, taking a screenshot currently takes multiple clicks. I know there are shortcuts, but I often prefer using the menu. Adding this would greatly improve usability.

### What do you need?

I had been using HYDE hyprland for a while and got very used to the display setting window for quickly changing resolutions and other settings, It would be cool if omarchy has something similar, i personally cant be bothered to keep going into the monitors.conf and adjusting things there, if only i could just use a key bind and a nice settings window for the display would pop up.

This would overall make Omarchy more usable and user friendly.

### Issue #2082: Using vim style navigation in omarchy-menu

- Opened: 2025-09-29T18:27:22Z
- Comments: 5
- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2082

### What do you need?

Currently, the only way to move up and down in the omarchy-menu is by using the arrow keys. I thought about implementing a way to also navigate the menu using Ctrl+J and Ctrl+K, in addition to the arrow keys. I’ve seen this in a few other programs (for example, fzf) that have it built in.

Since omarchy-menu uses [walker](https://github.com/abenz1267/walker), I checked for an implementation there, but it turns out the maintainer is not a big fan of this feature: [https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/issues/470](https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/issues/470). So I thought maybe a small patch in omarchy could be nice.

### What do you need?

It would be great to have a system notification (like a pop-up) whenever the audio output or input device changes. For example, when headphones are connected or disconnected, or when the sound output switches to another device.

This feature could work similar to macOS, where you get a small notification about the change. Alternatively, it could at least show a notification for connected Bluetooth (audio) devices.

adding pwfeedback to sudoers file can ensure that the sudo password prompt better aligns with the user's expectation of a password prompt. the user is used to having some kind of feedback in password prompts, and can be confused when first using sudo. and this can help the user identify errors in his password (accidental double clicks, or some other kind of problems). I know I've had these issues over the years.

I had to ask Perplexity which key to use, since Enter didn’t work. It turns out the correct key is Space.

DB48x is a high-end programmable scientific calculator with graphing capabilities, which is largely source-level compatible with the HP48 / HP50 calculators, but with a vastly enhanced version of RPL. There is a [online demo](https://48calc.org) if you are curious to see what it looks like. It includes an extensive [reference manual](https://github.com/c3d/db48x/blob/stable/help/db48x.md) which you can access by holding any key for more than a second. It features unlimited precision integer and decimal arithmetic, complex numbers in polar or rectangular form, vectors and matrices, symbolic computations, numerical and symbolic solvers, integration and differentiation, support for engineering units, a library with hundreds of scientific equations, and more…

It would be user friendly to, while waiting for solid fixes to the touchbar and physical key controls for keyboard backlight, to set the following:

## Overview

I've been thoroughly enjoying **Omarchy** over the past few weeks. However, I've noticed a significant drop in battery life on my laptop. The main culprit appears to be the **NVIDIA dGPU**, which remains active even when not in use. It does **not** enter low-power states such as `sleep`, `suspend`, or `d3cold`, resulting in unnecessary power drain.

My goal is to set up a proper **hybrid GPU configuration**, where the **Intel iGPU** handles all general rendering tasks, and the **NVIDIA dGPU** is only activated on-demand for specific applications (e.g., via `prime-run`). I have achieved this setup successfully in the past on **Arch Linux** using tools like `envycontrol` and `prime-run`.

I wanted to try using the new iso installer (with latest configurator https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-configurator). installed all within 7 minutes on my framework 13! now when i log into my machine... it looks like i have wifi (like the upper right corner looks like a full wifi status bar) but ping fails, as well as navigating to any website. not sure if anything changed in 2.1.0 but ive had 0 issues with getting wifi working in the past with omarchy (i have legitimately installed it probably over 50 times through alphas/betas/isos/etc as well as other distros).

I'm investigating and will edit the OP as I stumble upon any new findings.

edit: seems like they were disabled via software? i ran `sudo rfkill unblock all` and that fixed it. not sure if any changes were made recently that would have caused this.

Thanks for the great setup. `omarchy-online.iso` is a huge time-saver compared to installing everything from a base arch ISO.

One problem I encountered was that I had an existing Windows 11 installation on one hard drive, after installing from `omarchy-online.iso` to a different hard drive, the Windows boot entry was wiped.

I wrote up a guide on how to resolve this and get Windows 11 into the Limine boot menu here: [dual-boot-omarchy-windows](https://github.com/jackos/dotfiles/blob/main/dual-boot-omarchy-windows.md) as it took a few hours to figure out.

Follow up to [this issue](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/1115) closed earlier today.

I'm a longtime mac user (and linux newbie) who has been inspired to try out Omarchy after seeing the overwhelmingly positive community response to it. It's fast and beautiful and lives up to the hype! One thing I've noticed however, is that there seems to be no way to easily remap the SUPER functionality to a different key? 

I've seen the common recommendation to use kb_options, but what I'm looking for is a way to move the SUPER _functionality_ to another modifier and free up the SUPER key itself for other commands. For instance, I would love to be able to move the original SUPER functionality to a key like hyper. Once that's moved, I could use the SUPER key (command on mac) for other operations. In my case these operations would include copy, cut & paste (super-c / super-v, super-x) or jump to the start / end of lines (super-left, super-right) some of which currently conflict with other hyprland commands. 

### Issue #1340: Omarchy Steam installation and vulkan-driver provides dependencies leads to incorrect graphics configuration for iMac 2015 [AMD/ATI] Pitcairn PRO [Radeon HD 7850 / R7 265 / R9 270 1024SP]

mesa radv and amdvlk are incompatible drivers for [AMD/ATI] Pitcairn PRO [Radeon HD 7850 / R7 265 / R9 270 1024SP] and lead to vulkan failure.

This is observed by installing vulkan-tools and running vulkaninfo which yields vulkan instance errors. The is also observed in the form of steam games making use of vulkan failing to start altogether.

I'm not sure what the fix would look like in context since the /bin/omarchy-install-steam blanket installs all the vulkan-driver (yay -Ss vulkan-driver) provides that steam claims to depend on. Maybe a post installation step if/as needed to properly configure graphic cards, or a more tailored installation depending on what the hardware on the system is? Or perhaps this belongs closer to the baseline Omarchy OS installation proper (I think that this is probably the right answer to make best use of the hardware on the Hyprland desktop)?

Hypridle should support different actions based on power source. On battery, screensavers drain power unnecessarily. Just turning off the display would be better. When plugged in, screensavers are fine.

Example:

I was wondering how I can set my preferred date-time formatting in Chrome. On macOS I was used to having this in the system settings, but I can’t find a similar option here.  

Right now, a a default date-time picker starts the week on Sunday, while I would prefer it to start on Monday. I’d also like to have the format day-month-year instead of month-day-year. Is there a way to configure this in Omarchy or Chrome?

Hi,

I am having a weird bug in chrome and chromium on a multimonitor setup that I did not have before using omarchy.

On certain websites that have a leave page confirmation notify dialog, it does not show up in the upper middle of the screen, but instead off into the lower right hand corner. This happens regardless of which of my screens the browser window is on. If you will forgive my "art" skills:

Hi!

After updating to 2.0.0 (and 2.0.1), the computer can no longer recover from Suspense Mode. Whenever it goes to suspense, the screen for setting the password does not show and all I get is a black screen. I then need to press the power button to forcefully kill and restart it.

For reference this is my spec:

- Opened: 2025-08-24T19:02:57Z

The Omarchy default Hyprland environment variable "env = SDL_VIDEODRIVER, wayland" can prevent some games from opening. Error of "Failed to initialize dependencies".

This occurred when launching the game "Squad" through Steam, using Proton 9.0-4. My assumption is this is most likely something to do with EasyAntiCheat.

Commenting out "env = SDL_VIDEODRIVER, wayland" and reloading Hyprland allowed the game to open.

I attempted to install arch on an old MBP and ran into some interesting challenges.

This is relevant here now because I just attempted to install the iso and had similarly strange issues.

Expected: It sets the image as background and adds it to the list of available backgrounds for the current theme

Hi
When trying to adjust volume only the OSD part came up but nothing happened.
I tried looking trough the keybindings but couldnt see anything directly.

So i copied this from my old arch hyprland install from the laptop and now adjusting volume works fine.

I've had this working on my primary machine running Arch + Gnome without problems, but with Omarchy on my ThinkPad X1, I can't `esc` or `ctrl-c` out of the fingerprint auth to get to password. The only option is to wait for the long time out. All menu-based options trap `ctrl-c` and quit. For terminal-based auth, `ctrl-c` does get me to a password prompt, but it's captured as the first character in the password, making it impossible to successfully enter my password.

The only exception is `hypridle`, where, of course, I can just type the password.

The cleanest approach I've found has been to do something like this in `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`, before the line containing `pam_fprintd.so`:

Describe the bug
When selecting a file to upload from a web browser (e.g., Chromium/Firefox) under Omarchy (Hyprland), the file chooser dialog is extremely outdated — it looks like a GTK2 file picker instead of the modern GTK4/libadwaita dialog.

Walker supports image grid selectors. I'm thinking it would be nice to experiment with that for theme picking and probably also background picking. Can be done with:

```
[ui.window.box.scroll.list]
grid = true

My laptop has an intel gpu and when I plugged in HDMI the colors looked very washed (this also happened on X11)

This is a known problem with intel GPUs and the arch linux wiki has a fix for this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Intel_graphics#Fix_colors_for_Wayland

Can this become a part of the omarchy installer?

When using the "Suspend" on BeeLink SER9, after issuing "suspend" Beelink device fans spin up and what I see immediately is a lock screen (so looks like it is not suspending). After unlocking, `WLAN0` interface is gone. Running `lspci -knnd ::0280` shows:
