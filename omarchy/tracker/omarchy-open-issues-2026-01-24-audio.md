### Issue #3065: Caffeinate: Keep computer awake (Block sreensaver, lockscreen when presenting or long running tasks)

- Opened: 2025-11-02T09:24:06Z
- Comments: 8
- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/3065

### What do you need?

When I have a presentation, or if I want to run a long running backup without the system to sleep, lock or turn on screen saver, on MacOS I had an app [Lungo](https://setapp.com/apps/lungo), but there are many others like Caffeinate, etc.

Also when I run a Google Meet meeting, after a couple of time, my screen will freeze, get black for 4-6 seconds, and then go back (for the participans on the other end, my video freezes quickly. Audio works always). It feels like the screen saver interupts (as I might not have moved anything) - but I not 100%. So I'd like to have an awakening SW to try this.

### What do you need?

On Razer Blade laptops, the left and right audio channels (for the built in speakers) are swapped when running Linux (tested with both Ubuntu and Arch). It would be nice to have a feature to toggle swapping the audio channels.

- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2067

### What do you need?

It would be great to have a system notification (like a pop-up) whenever the audio output or input device changes. For example, when headphones are connected or disconnected, or when the sound output switches to another device.

This feature could work similar to macOS, where you get a small notification about the change. Alternatively, it could at least show a notification for connected Bluetooth (audio) devices.

### Issue #1776: Laptop / Hybrid GPU Power Management Issue (NVIDIA, iGPU + dGPU)

- Opened: 2025-09-18T15:55:23Z
- Comments: 12
- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/1776

## Overview

I've been thoroughly enjoying **Omarchy** over the past few weeks. However, I've noticed a significant drop in battery life on my laptop. The main culprit appears to be the **NVIDIA dGPU**, which remains active even when not in use. It does **not** enter low-power states such as `sleep`, `suspend`, or `d3cold`, resulting in unnecessary power drain.

My goal is to set up a proper **hybrid GPU configuration**, where the **Intel iGPU** handles all general rendering tasks, and the **NVIDIA dGPU** is only activated on-demand for specific applications (e.g., via `prime-run`). I have achieved this setup successfully in the past on **Arch Linux** using tools like `envycontrol` and `prime-run`.

### Issue #1772: Easier audio recording flow?

- Opened: 2025-09-18T14:38:04Z
- Comments: 1
- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/1772

### What do you need?

The one thing that chafes for me with Linux is recording any sort of audio recording with a high quality microphone.   Anything in this space feels like you're thrown back to using slackware in 2003.

I currently use a separate laptop for recording youtube videos, doing podcast interviews, meetings etc, because it's such a hassle to set up microphone filters and so on to not get my high quality mic to pick up nighmare ASMR with breathing noises, swallowing noises, etc.

### What do you need?

I’d like to enhance the user experience by adding a visual representation of the audio being played using a wave bar. The key features would include:

1. **Wave Bar:** Display a dynamic waveform showing the progress of the currently playing audio.

### Issue #1422: Wifi sometimes stops working and requires rfkill or restarting iwd to work

I wanted to try using the new iso installer (with latest configurator https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-configurator). installed all within 7 minutes on my framework 13! now when i log into my machine... it looks like i have wifi (like the upper right corner looks like a full wifi status bar) but ping fails, as well as navigating to any website. not sure if anything changed in 2.1.0 but ive had 0 issues with getting wifi working in the past with omarchy (i have legitimately installed it probably over 50 times through alphas/betas/isos/etc as well as other distros).

I'm investigating and will edit the OP as I stumble upon any new findings.

edit: seems like they were disabled via software? i ran `sudo rfkill unblock all` and that fixed it. not sure if any changes were made recently that would have caused this.

When installing in Hyper-V, Omarchy doesn't audio input or output.

I tried various suggestions I found through Google without success. Did anyone manage to get this working?

I attempted to install arch on an old MBP and ran into some interesting challenges.

This is relevant here now because I just attempted to install the iso and had similarly strange issues.

Hi
When trying to adjust volume only the OSD part came up but nothing happened.
I tried looking trough the keybindings but couldnt see anything directly.

So i copied this from my old arch hyprland install from the laptop and now adjusting volume works fine.

### Issue #394: suspend on BeeLink SER9 (and new Framework 13 AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370)

When using the "Suspend" on BeeLink SER9, after issuing "suspend" Beelink device fans spin up and what I see immediately is a lock screen (so looks like it is not suspending). After unlocking, `WLAN0` interface is gone. Running `lspci -knnd ::0280` shows:

```bash
c3:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Wi-Fi 6 AX200 [8086:2723] (rev 1a)
