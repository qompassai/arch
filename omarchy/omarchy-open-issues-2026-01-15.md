### Issue #4033: add numPad numbers support for tiling navigation

- Opened: 2025-12-31T08:32:19Z
- Comments: 5
- Labels: 
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/4033

Omarchy currently only recognizes keybinds from the main keyboard’s top row numbers, not the numpad—could you add support for numpad keys (e.g., Numpad1)? 
For example, moving the focused window to virtual desktop 1 could be bound to SUPER SHIFT Numpad1, just like SUPER SHIFT 1 works now. This would improve flexibility for users who rely on the numpad for shortcuts.

I've been trying to set this up by hand from the `~/.config/hypr/input.conf `without success so far

### What do you need?

I was thinking it would be nice to access the power menu from the locked session state.
When I suspend my computer it doesn't lock automatically, and that's fine, but I wish I could lock the session and then then suspend my pc.
Either in one click or by accessing a small power menu from the lock screen without having to unlock it. Same as when it goes idle.

- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/3065

### What do you need?

When I have a presentation, or if I want to run a long running backup without the system to sleep, lock or turn on screen saver, on MacOS I had an app [Lungo](https://setapp.com/apps/lungo), but there are many others like Caffeinate, etc.

Also when I run a Google Meet meeting, after a couple of time, my screen will freeze, get black for 4-6 seconds, and then go back (for the participans on the other end, my video freezes quickly. Audio works always). It feels like the screen saver interupts (as I might not have moved anything) - but I not 100%. So I'd like to have an awakening SW to try this.

On iOS (with e.g. macOS or Windows) I’m able to use my iPhone to exchange authentication keys (passkeys / FIDO2 / WebAuthn) and approve sign-ins, but this does not work when using Omarchy.

Within the [configurator](https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-iso/blob/main/configs/airootfs/root/configurator), we currently only support selecting and wiping a full disk.

This leaves a fair number of users who have a legitimate need for dual booting out in the cold and stuck going through a manual install process. This is less than ideal, for many reasons; not the least of which are user experience and just generally being more error prone.

We should add a **simple** way for users to install Omarchy using the ISO. There are effectively 2 ways I think this could be accomplished easily.

### What do you need?

It would be very useful to have a way to see how you typed your password wrong on the lock screen. And indicator for caps lock and num lock would also be interesting. And maybe also a keyboard indicator as mentioned in #2865 


### Issue #2880: Add a matching SDDM login screen theme

- Opened: 2025-10-26T17:41:03Z

- Labels: enhancement, help wanted
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2880

### What do you need?

While we never really see the SDDM login screen due to autologin, I do think it'd be nice to have one that matches the general aesthetic of the Hyprlock screen for instances where it may be seen (eg. Hyprland crashes) or if you're a user who uses multiple user accounts and need to switch.

Most login screens I've come across are massive packs of options OR are just overly complex. I think it's important that we maintain a simple and consistent aesthetic, and preferably also update the BG that's shown on theme change as well.

### What do you need?

Often you open a window and want to store it in another workspace. At present, that's a pain in the ass because you follow it there by default. I propose control +  super +  {num}  to move a window to workspace {num}.

Adding the following to tiling-v2.config achieves this:


### Issue #2871: Keyboard Layout Automation

- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2871

### What do you need?

### Summary

Omarchy currently lacks a built-in keyboard layout switching mechanism, requiring users to manually add and configure layouts via system settings or Waybar. However, this limitation causes a critical usability issue during the authentication phase after auto logout.

### What do you need?

Note: this goes beyond NVidia driver support https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/4

"The CUDA development environment relies on tight integration with the host development environment, including the host compiler and C runtime libraries, and is therefore only supported on distribution versions that have been qualified for this CUDA Toolkit release."

It would be helpful for users who use multiple keyboard layouts to see which layout is currently active for the password input on the lock screen. Alternatively, perhaps password input could be restricted to the US-EN layout only.

- Comments: 2
- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2825

### What do you need?

The About dialog for Omarchy does not use the default terminal app. Hence, it displays the Alacritty version even if another terminal has been installed and is being used as default, i.e. $TERMINAL = Ghostty or Kitty. I understand that Alacritty is still used for specialized tooling, even if another terminal is used as default.

I have modified my omarchy-launch-about to support Ghostty and Kitty too, as I am a Ghostty user myself.

### What do you need?

In recovery situations, it's often the case that we need to be able to use chroot to access our device from a failed state. It'd be great to add a tool that could be included in the ISO that makes this process a lot more seamless to accomplish if you have the ISO available to you on a USB to aid in debug / recovery.

Below are the steps I commonly use and supply to other. The idea is we could utilize gum prompts to allow the user to select the partitions instead and then handle some of the bits in the middle so we only have to get user input where we need it.

### What do you need?

I'd like the ability to navigate menus (eg `Super + Space`, `Super + Alt + Space`, etc.) with the `PgUp` and `PgDn` keys on my keyboard. Navigating with the arrow keys is often not as efficient, as the arrow keys only move up/down one item at a time. `PgUp` and `PgDn` keys should advance multiple items at a time (eg 10 items up or down, even better a viewable page length although the programming on that is significantly more I bet).


### Issue #2742: Wi-Fi adapter not recognized or configurable in Omarchy 3.1 (worked partially in 3.0)

- Comments: 3

### What do you need?

I’m experiencing a Wi-Fi connectivity issue in Omarchy 3.1. My PC’s built-in Wi-Fi doesn’t function unless I use an external USB Wi-Fi antenna/adapter. On other operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, and Fedora, I can choose between the internal Wi-Fi and the external adapter directly from the Wi-Fi settings.

However, in Omarchy 3.1, this option no longer appears. The system only shows one non-functional Wi-Fi interface. In Omarchy 3.0, the external antenna was somehow working automatically without me having to select it — when I unplugged it, the Wi-Fi stopped working, meaning it was being used by default. Now in Omarchy 3.1, it does not connect at all, even when the antenna is plugged in.

This error means VAAPI wasn’t initialized correctly because the proper driver was missing. And according to assada's comment, the solution depends on the GPU vendor:

### Issue #2624: Enhancement Suggestion: Support sequential upgrades instead of big jumps

- Opened: 2025-10-20T15:43:48Z
- Comments: 0
- Labels: enhancement
- Link: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2624

I upgraded one of my notebooks from Omarchy 1.x (just before the first ISO) straight to 3.1. During the install I saw a few problems — for example, an ln step failed during migration. After the upgrade, some configs and keybindings stopped working, and a few settings looked reset.

My guess is the migration expects files/state that were introduced after 1.x, so jumping directly to 3.1 skips required steps. I’ve seen similar upgrade pains on Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Mandriva; you can mitigate them, but they tend to happen with big version jumps.

Suggestion: define “destination points” (upgrade waypoints). For example: 1 → 2 only, 2 → 3, 3 → latest. Even better if the installer/docs guide or enforce that path, or run a preflight check to warn/block unsupported jumps.

## Issue

After installing Omarchy, I noticed boot time was around 2 minutes 39 seconds, which seemed excessive. After investigating with `systemd-analyze` and `journalctl`, I found that `tpm2.target` was waiting approximately 90 seconds for TPM devices (`/dev/tpm0` and `/dev/tpmrm0`) that don't exist on my system.

### What do you need?

First, thanks for a great out-of-box arch experience, mainly been dabbling, but its been fun! Here's an idea I wanted to do as a home project

Take a mini-pc such as https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8845hs?_pos=1&_fid=90f0072bc&_ss=c. This PC would live in my networking closet, and then be primarily accessed remotely, for me from MSTSC but really any remote-desktop client. I started down the road of installing and configuring xrdp/Xorg and making some progress, but its been a slog, I wanted to offer the idea up here in case I'm going down a bad path or there is a more elegant (Omarchy worthy) solution. I'll keep tooling around and update this if I find anything good.
